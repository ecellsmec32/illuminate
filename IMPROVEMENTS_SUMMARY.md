- ❌ Attendees: HARD DELETE (permanently removes from DB)

**Required Actions:**
1. **Backend Changes Needed:**
   ```python
   # Add to Event model
   deleted_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=True)
   deleted_by = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=True)
   
   # Add to Attendee model  
   deleted_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=True)
   deleted_by = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=True)
   ```

2. **Frontend Changes Needed:**
   - Update delete functions to use soft delete
   - Add "Restore" functionality
   - Add "Permanently Delete" option (admin only)
   - Show deleted items in separate view

- ❌ **organizer/scanner.html**: Still using Bootstrap  
- ❌ **organizer/event-details.html**: Still using Bootstrap

### 8. **Advanced Features Missing**
